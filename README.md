# PyTorch-based-Migraine-Prediction
This project explores the use of deep learning to predict migraine subtypes based on patient-reported symptoms. Built in collaboration with a computational EEG researcher, our goal was to understand how structured clinical features — like nausea, photophobia, and intensity — could be used to assist diagnosis and classification of migraine types.
